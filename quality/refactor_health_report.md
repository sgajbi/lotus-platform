# Enterprise Refactor Health Report

Generated: `2026-06-20T03:18:19Z`

## Completed Slices

1. Baseline and CI/reporting foundation.
2. Skill guidance hardening so backend, frontend, CI, documentation, and code-review workflows
   default to the Lotus Bank-Buyable Engineering Contract and non-degradation posture.
3. New-service scaffold hardening so freshly generated Lotus apps start with bank-buyable
   quality scorecards, architecture rules, CI-quality notes, refactor decisions, and
   README/repo-context/wiki references.
4. Enterprise refactoring instruction sync repair so deployed app-local copies come from the
   platform canonical playbook, support `-CheckOnly` drift checks, and use registry/discovery
   default scope rather than a single app-specific source.

## Current Gate Posture

The quality baseline is report-only. `--check` validates that the required reporting surface exists
and remains wired into the platform repo checks.

## Conscious Guidance Review

The enterprise refactor requires keeping README, docs, wiki, repo context, central agent context,
and relevant skill guidance synchronized as code truth changes. This baseline slice updates
`lotus-ci-enforcement-governance` to point future agents at the measured baseline, scorecard, and
health report before any quality signal is promoted from report-only to blocking.
