# Enterprise Refactor Health Report

Generated: `2026-06-20T03:07:40Z`

## Completed Slices

1. Baseline and CI/reporting foundation.
2. Skill guidance hardening so backend, frontend, CI, documentation, and code-review workflows
   default to the Lotus Bank-Buyable Engineering Contract and non-degradation posture.

## Evidence

1. Baseline generator: `automation/generate_enterprise_backend_quality_baseline.py`
2. Baseline report: `quality/baseline_report.md`
3. Scorecard: `quality/quality_scorecard.md`
4. Repo check hook: `automation/Invoke-PlatformRepoChecks.ps1`
5. Skill guidance: `codex/skills/lotus-backend-delivery-governance/SKILL.md`
6. Skill guidance: `codex/skills/lotus-frontend-delivery-governance/SKILL.md`
7. Skill guidance: `codex/skills/lotus-ci-enforcement-governance/SKILL.md`
8. Skill guidance: `codex/skills/lotus-readme-wiki-governance/SKILL.md`
9. Skill guidance: `codex/skills/lotus-codebase-review-ledger/SKILL.md`

## Current Gate Posture

The quality baseline is report-only. `--check` validates that the required reporting surface exists
and remains wired into the platform repo checks.

## Conscious Guidance Review

The enterprise refactor requires keeping README, docs, wiki, repo context, central agent context,
and relevant skill guidance synchronized as code truth changes. This baseline slice updates
`lotus-ci-enforcement-governance` to point future agents at the measured baseline, scorecard, and
health report before any quality signal is promoted from report-only to blocking.
