"""Source files must not carry control bytes a shell escape produced.

A backslash escape written through an interpreting heredoc is expanded before
the file exists: ``\\b`` in a regex becomes a literal 0x08 backspace, ``\\t`` a
tab, ``\\f`` a formfeed. The corruption is invisible by construction — a
terminal does not render 0x08, a diff shows nothing unusual, and re-reading the
source cannot see it. Only the bytes can.

It is not hypothetical. A sibling repository's guard compiled to
``'\\x08([A-Z][a-z]+)-only\\x08'`` and passed on the exact defect it was written
to catch, because no real text contains a backspace. A guard corrupted this way
does not fail loudly; it silently matches nothing.
